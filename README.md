# What is this ?
This is the code of Minecraft Wii U IP Sniffer, a software, a RTM Tool for sniff players IP in Minecraft and have other informations.    
As this software is very powerful (with an IP you can do a lot of things and I'm afraid it will destroy the Minecraft Wii U community), I put a password for the code of the main form and for the software.    
I hope you will understand my choice...    
Here is a picture to show what the software looks like and to show its power :
